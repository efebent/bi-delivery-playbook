# Design Principles

This playbook is built on the following principles:

- The methodology is **Change-driven**
- Not every request is a project
- Jira is the **single source of truth**
- Gates ensure clarity, not bureaucracy
- Documentation supports decision-making, not compliance
- Small changes prioritize speed, large changes prioritize control
